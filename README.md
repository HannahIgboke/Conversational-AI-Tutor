# Objective

Create a Conversational AI Data Science Tutor tasked to discuss only data related topics and questions.

# User Interface
The application has a clean and intuitive user interface built using Streamlit that allows users to be able to easily input their questions.

# App Functionality
- Utilized the Gemini API for code review functionality.
- The application answers only data science related topics and questions.
- Provides clear and straightforward clarifications and answers to questions.
- When queried on topics outside data science, kindly reminds the user of its core area - data science.

This functionality is implemented in the code using system instructions as seen in the snapshot below:
